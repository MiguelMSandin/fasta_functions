# fasta-functions

Random scripts to deal with common fasta files manipulations and other fancy stuff. Such as split an alignment in defined positions, concatenate different fasta files, extract/remove sequences, reorder an alignment based on a tree, get the entropy on each position from an alignment, get the consensus sequence from an alignment, ...

Download and move the scripts to you prefered folder (e.g.;```/usr/lobal/bin/```) and start using them (you might have to make them executable: ```chmod +x *.py```).  
Further details in the help of each script (```script -h```).

Please feel free to report bugs or suggestions.
